[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/StockbitClient.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StockbitClient/) 

## Installation

Install via NuGet:
```sh
dotnet add package StockbitClient
```

## Description
A library to access Stockbit (Indonesian stock website). It can automatically login, but you need to bypass the CAPTCHA manually.
After login, you get the token, and you can use that token to do anything else (get stock data, etc).
Currently it only has login function, I will add more in the future
